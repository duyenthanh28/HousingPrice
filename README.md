San Francisco consistently ranks among the most expensive real estate markets in the world, and it is one of the most
densely populated cities in the U.S. The housing price or rental price in San Francisco Bay Area is accelerating at
shocking rates. From 2010 to 2017, the median price of a single-family home in San Francisco has gone from
approximately &775,000 to $1.5 million. In this project we have tried find out if there is any affect on the housing
price or rental price because of the current Pandemic and possible economic downturn.
